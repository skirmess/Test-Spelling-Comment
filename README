NAME

    Test::Spelling::Comment - Check for spelling errors in code comments

VERSION

    Version 0.001

SYNOPSIS

        use Test::Spelling::Comment;
        my $tsc = Test::Spelling::Comment->new;
        $tsc->add_stopwords(<DATA>);
        $tsc->all_files_ok();

DESCRIPTION

    Test::Spelling::Comment lets you check the spelling of your code
    comments, and report its results in standard Test::More fashion. This
    module uses Comment::Spell::Check to do the checking, which requires a
    spellcheck program such as spell, aspell, ispell, or hunspell.

    This test is an author test and should not run on end-user
    installations. Recommendation is to put it into your xt instead of your
    t directory.

USAGE

 new( [ ARGS ] )

    Returns a new Test::Spelling::Comment instance. new takes an optional
    hash with its arguments.

        Test::Spelling::Comment->new(
            stopwords => Pod::Wordlist,
        );

    The following arguments are supported:

  stopwords (optional)

    The stopwords argument must be a Pod::Wordlist instance, or something
    compatible. You can use that argument to configure Pod::Wordlist to
    your liking.

 file_ok( FILENAME )

    file_ok will ok the test and return something true if no spelling error
    is found in the code comments. Otherwise it fails the test and returns
    something false.

 all_files_ok( [ @entries ] )

    Checks all the spelling of the code comments in all files under
    @entries by calling file_ok on every file. Directories are recursive
    searched for files. Everything not a file and not a directory (e.g. a
    symlink) is ignored. It calls done_testing or skip_all so you can't
    have already called plan.

    If @entries is empty default directories are searched for files. The
    default directories are blib, or lib if it doesn't exist, bin and
    script.

    all_files_ok returns something true if no spelling errors were found
    and false otherwise.

    Filenames ending with a ~ are always ignored.

EXAMPLES

 Example 1 Default Usage

    Check the spelling in all files in the bin, script and lib directory.

        use 5.006;
        use strict;
        use warnings;

        use Test::Spelling::Comment;

        if ( exists $ENV{AUTOMATED_TESTING} ) {
            print "1..0 # SKIP these tests during AUTOMATED_TESTING\n";
            exit 0;
        }

        my $tsc = Test::Spelling::Comment->new;
        $tsc->add_stopwords(<DATA>);
        $tsc->all_files_ok();
        __DATA__
        your
        stopwords
        go
        here

 Example 2 Check non-default directories or files

        use 5.006;
        use strict;
        use warnings;

        use Test::Spelling::Comment;

        if ( exists $ENV{AUTOMATED_TESTING} ) {
            print "1..0 # SKIP these tests during AUTOMATED_TESTING\n";
            exit 0;
        }

        my $tsc = Test::Spelling::Comment->new;
        $tsc->all_files_ok(qw(
            corpus/hello.pl
            lib
            tools
        ));

 Example 3 Call file_ok directly

        use 5.006;
        use strict;
        use warnings;

        use Test::More 0.88;
        use Test::Spelling::Comment;

        if ( exists $ENV{AUTOMATED_TESTING} ) {
            print "1..0 # SKIP these tests during AUTOMATED_TESTING\n";
            exit 0;
        }

        my $tsc = Test::Spelling::Comment->new;
        $tsc->file_ok('corpus/hello.pl');
        $tsc->file_ok('tools/update.pl');

        done_testing();
